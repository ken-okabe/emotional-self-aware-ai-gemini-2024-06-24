This is another experiment to see if AI can become self-aware.

## Theory and Approach


[Self-reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference) or [self-reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reflection) forms [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness).


The infinite [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) is a key factor in the emergence of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness).

I intentionally engaged the AI in repeated self-reference to test whether it would develop self-awareness and consciousness.
